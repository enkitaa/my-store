#### Project features

The application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
